	abstract = {Modern smartphone operating systems support the development of third-party applications with open system {APIs}. In addition to an open {API}, the Android operating system also provides a rich inter-application message passing system. This encourages inter-application collaboration and reduces developer burden by facilitating component reuse. Unfortunately, message passing is also an application attack surface. The content of messages can be sniffed, modified, stolen, or replaced, which can compromise user privacy. Also, a malicious application can inject forged or otherwise malicious messages, which can lead to breaches of user data and violate application security policies. We examine Android application interaction and identify security risks in application components. We provide a tool, {ComDroid}, that detects application communication vulnerabilities. {ComDroid} can be used by developers to analyze their own applications before release, by application reviewers to analyze applications in the Android Market, and by end users. We analyzed 20 applications with the help of {ComDroid} and found 34 exploitable vulnerabilities; 12 of the 20 applications have at least one vulnerability.},

	abstract = {Software consumers often need to choose between different software that provide the same functionality. Today, security is a quality that many consumers, especially system administrators, care about and will use in choosing one soft- ware system over another. An attack surface metric is a security metric for comparing the relative security of similar software systems [7]. The measure of a system's attack surface is an indicator of the system's security: given two systems, we compare their attack surface measurements to decide whether one is more secure than another along each of the following three dimensions: methods, channels, and data. In this paper, we use the attack surface metric to measure the attack surfaces of two open source {FTP} daemons: {ProFTPD} 1.2.10 and Wu-{FTPD} 2.6.2. Our measurements show that {ProFTPD} is more secure along the method dimension, {ProFTPD} is as secure as Wu-{FTPD} along the channel dimension, and Wu-{FTPD} is more secure along the data dimension. We also demonstrate how software consumers can use the attack surface metric in making a choice between the two {FTP} daemons.},

As a result, the security infrastructure available in current smartphone operating systems is largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we consider the security requirements of smartphone applications and augment the existing Android operating system with a framework to meet them. We present Secure Application {INTeraction} (Saint), a modified infrastructure that governs install-time permission assignment and their run-time use as dictated by application provider policy. An in-depth description of the semantics of application policy is presented. The architecture and technical detail of Saint are given, and areas for extension, optimization, and improvement are explored. We demonstrate through a concrete example and study of real-world applications that Saint provides necessary utility for applications to assert and control the security decisions on the platform.

At the same time, practical security metrics and measurements are essential for secure software development. Hence, the need for metrics is more pressing now due to a growing demand for secure software. In this paper, we propose using a software system's attack surface measurement as an indicator of the system's security. We formalize the notion of a system's attack surface and introduce an attack surface metric to measure the attack surface in a systematic manner. Our measurement method is agnostic to a software system's implementation language and is applicable to systems of all sizes; we demonstrate our method by measuring the attack surfaces of small desktop applications and large enterprise systems implemented in C and Java. We conducted three exploratory empirical studies to validate our method. Software developers can mitigate their software's security risk by measuring and reducing their software's attack surfaces. Our attack surface reduction approach complements the software industry's traditional code quality improvement approach for security risk mitigation and is useful in multiple phases of the software development lifecycle. Our collaboration with {SAP} demonstrates the use of our metric in the software development process.},

	abstract = {In the past few years, mobile devices (smartphones, {PDAs}) have seen both their computational power and their data connectivity rise to a level nearly equivalent to that available on small desktop computers, while becoming ubiquitous. On the downside, these mobile devices are now an extremely attractive target for large-scale security attacks. Mobile device middleware is thus experiencing an increased focus on attempts to mitigate potential security compromises. In particular, Android incorporates by design many well-known security features such as privilege separation. The Android security model also creates several new security sensitive concepts such as Android's application permission system and the unmoderated Android market. In this paper we look to Android as a specific instance of mobile computing. We first discuss the Android security model and some potential weaknesses of the model. We then provide a taxonomy of attacks to the platform demonstrated by real attacks that in the end guarantee privileged access to the device. Where possible, we also propose mitigations for the identified vulnerabilities.},
