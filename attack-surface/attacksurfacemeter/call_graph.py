            Method attempts to a fix a call graph using a reference call 
            graph which is assumed to be more comprehensive than the one
            being fixed. The notion of fixing a call graph entails 
            identifying a node without function_signature and replacing it 
            with an identical node from the reference call graph that has a 
            function_signature.

            A call graph is required to be fixed to ensure compatibility of 
            equivalent nodes so that later when merging the two call graphs' 
            sets of edges, networkx doesn't think the cflow and gprof calls 
            are different only because one of them doesn't have a 
            function_signature associated to it.

            Implementation detail:
                networkx internally uses a dictionary as the data structure 
                to store nodes. Modifying an attribute that is used in the 
                computation of the object's hash will invalidate the hash 
                leaving the graph in an inconsistent state. Hence, fixing 
                nodes involves replacing existing nodes with their fixed 
                equivalents.
